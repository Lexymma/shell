Technically speaking, in bash if I remember correctly, when the env is being 
printed by the env command it is displayed by asciibetic order but when using 
export command it is displayed by the order of the pointers to the variable or something similar. 
It's not required by the subject to to have the exact same behavior but during 
the defense you have to be prepared to defend your choice to not implement these types of behavior
